            <div class="accordion-body">The scholarship application process consists of the following steps:

                1. Screening: Applicants are evaluated based on their academic performance, NSET scores, and a recorded personal interview.
                2. Document Submission: Candidates need to submit the required supporting documents based on the specific category of scholarship they are applying for.
                3. Sponsor's Assessment: Once the applicant's profile, including the recorded personal interview, statement of purpose (SOP), and supporting documents, is complete, it is shared with potential sponsors. We match your profile with sponsors whose criteria align with your qualifications. In some cases, a one-on-one meeting between the sponsor and the candidate may be arranged upon request.
                4. Results: The sponsors announce the final decisions regarding the scholarship recipients. The chosen candidates are informed about the outcome of their applications.
                
                It's important to note that students who are awarded scholarships are typically expected to maintain a minimum CGPA requirement to continue receiving the scholarship in subsequent years. This ensures that recipients remain focused on their academic progress while benefiting from the financial support provided by the scholarship program.</div>
