                    Formal degrees from reputed universities will enable our students to be eligible for the following, <ul> <li>Masters outside India via exams like GRE</li> <li>Getting a work visa for migrating abroad</li> <li>MBA in India and abroad via exams like CAT & GMAT</li> <li>Government Jobs like IAS, IPS via exams like UPSC</li> </ul> <br /><br />Therefore, along with Scaler School of Technology's UG program, valued by top tech companies, our students are advised to pursue a Bachelor's and Master's degree in parallel to ensure they have more flexibility with their career outcomes. <br /><br />By doing this, we want to bring the best of both worlds together. The UG Program will ensure our students have access to the latest curriculum, practical experience, and the opportunity to pursue a 1-year tech internship that ensures they are set up for success in Computer Science in India & abroad. <br /><br />On the other hand, our students will also have the opportunity to apply to an online Bachelor of Science in Computer Science by BITS Pilani which is an Institute of Eminence recognized by the University Grants Commission (UGC). Since its establishment in 1964, BITS Pilani has remained one of the most prestigious universities in India. They offer an online Bachelors of Science (B.Sc.) in Computer Science, designed and delivered by BITS Pilani exclusively on Coursera. This online degree program runs independently with Scaler School of Technology's residential undergraduate program, and students can pursue both in parallel. More details on the Degree Program are available <a class='link' href='https://www.coursera.org/degrees/bachelor-of-science-computer-science-bits' target='_blank'>here</a>. <br /><br />It's important to note that admission to the degree program is solely at the discretion of BITS Pilani. Students will have to complete all requirements as set by BITS Pilani for the grant of the degree in the BITS Degree Program. <br /><br />As per Regulation 22 of the UGC (Open and Distance Learning Programmes and Online Programmes) Regulations, 2020, all undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, awarded through Open and Distance Learning mode and/or Online mode by Indian Higher Educational Institutions, recognised by UGC, are treated as equivalent to the corresponding awards of the degrees/diplomas offered through conventional mode. <br /><br />Students also have the opportunity to apply for an online Master of Science in Computer Science from Woolf, which is accredited by reputable organizations such as the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) and CES. Woolf is heralded as the world's first global collegiate higher education institution, dedicated to expanding access to academic excellence. It leverages technology and a global network of member colleges to offer accredited degrees, aiming to bridge the gap between talent and opportunity on a worldwide scaleâ€‹. Woolf being a foreign institute is not recognised by UGC/AICTE, however the masters degree awarded upon successful completion of the program will be accredited under European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS), a widely recognised accreditation system accepted by universities & organisations in the US, Europe, Canada, and numerous other countries. Enrolment of a learner into the masters program will be subject to the discretion of Woolf, and the final decision to award the degree rests with Woolf. <br /><br />These industry-recognized degrees enable our graduates to explore job opportunities with leading technology companies worldwide, eligibility for exams like GRE, GMAT, CAT, Civil Services exams and qualify for government jobs and further studies both within India and abroad.
